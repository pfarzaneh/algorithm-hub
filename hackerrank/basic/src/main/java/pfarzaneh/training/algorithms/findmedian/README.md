**Find the Median**

The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. 

The same number of elements occur after it as before. 

Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median.

Example: arr=**[1,2,4,3,5]**

The sorted array=**[1,2,3,4,5]**

The middle element and the median is **3**.
