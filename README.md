**Data Structures and Algorithms**

This repo contains implementations for various data structures and algorithms as I go ahead of my way.

- The purpose of this repo is just educational.
- Some DSA impls are based on the online tests available on practice sites like hacker rank. These DSAs are categorized on the respective directory.
- Other DSA impls are based on a problem, so have been put in a directory of their own name.

**Note:** Algorithms from hacker rank tests are pretty well documented.
